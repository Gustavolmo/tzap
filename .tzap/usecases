Tzap is a CLI tool that simplifies mundane tasks with both code and managing ChatGPT. It's terminal tool usge is: "tzap semantic:gitcommit" and "magicwand <file> <prompt>" It also offers a solid prompt engine with control flow, loops, recursion and templates.


It makes it a breeze when I use to make Semantic Commits!

- Automate GPT copy pasting
- Prompt string concat
- Create magic functions that evaluate gpt prompts rather than code.
- Use semantic commits
- Apply templates and functions to existing Tzaps

It can be installed using 

npm install -g tzap

or

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzapio/tzap/main/cli/install.sh | bash
